title: What is a good texteditor?
---
In my hobby projects, and home workstation, I try to use Neovim.

It's not because I'm a hardcore vim-motions pro, but because I want to be.
At work, we can choose between eclipse or VS Code, Visual Studio or sakura editor, so I currently use VS Code with VIM emulation, which works great on the main workstation, but the old surface laptop I use for remote work, lags out completely.
I will never understand why any workplace would force you to use strict set of tools, when there are free and open source software as great as Neovim, (Zed also looks promising).

I wonder if other workplaces forces you to use tools in this way...
