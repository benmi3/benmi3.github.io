title: What I Enjoy
---
My Hobby is mainly IT. If it's PC's, programming, gaming, etc.. If it has anything electric in it, I'm most likely interested in it.

I have always been interested in IT, but never really got into studying it, so when I started university, I actually chose to study Japanese instead, as it was a country known for technology (Sony, PlayStation, Nintendo, etc.). Now I have lived in Japan for a few years, worked as an electric engineer for 2.5 years, and been in the embedded software industry for half a year, and I'm enjoying learning new things as I go. 

When I started in the working as an electric engineer (I know that to be titled as an engineer, you need some level of study, and I don't have that, but tldr; I worked as an electric engineer), I was manly focused in learning ladder, the main PLC programming language. I mastered the basics really fast, and started to move on to function blocks, and so on. Fast forward 1,5 years, we got a programming job, and needed someone that could write python. I said yes, and that was the beginning of my move towards real software development.

Fast forward to today, I use everything from C/C++ and web(html,css,js) in my daily work, and try to sneak inn other languages where I can (created cli tool with Go). I enjoy learning new things, and like the challenge of things I don't understand. The only thing I worry about at this moment, is not focusing enough on one language, and mastering that, becoming a jack of all trades, but master of none. But learning news things is what I enjoy.
